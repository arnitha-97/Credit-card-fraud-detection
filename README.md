# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The approach leverages an ensemble of models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression to improve classification performance. The dataset is processed with techniques such as one-hot encoding, imputation of missing values, and handling class imbalance using oversampling. The ensemble model is evaluated using metrics like ROC AUC and precision-recall scores.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and class imbalance.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combines multiple classifiers for robust predictions.
- **Evaluation:** Includes ROC AUC, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrix visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train the ensemble model using the provided script.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using ROC AUC, precision-recall, and confusion matrix plots.
